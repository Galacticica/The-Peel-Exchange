# 🍌 The Peel Exchange

A banana-themed stock market simulation game designed to teach financial literacy through gamification.

To try it yourself:
1. Clone down the repo.
2. Run ```uv sync```

- **Risk-free learning**: Practice trading without real money
- **Real-time market simulation**: Stocks fluctuate and respond to random market events
